Python Coding Conventions
============================================

This convention guide serves to establish consistency and readability in our python projects. Like all convention guides, this one is imperfect and in some cases, the convention might be at odds with backwards compatibility or code readability. In these cases, the convention should be abandoned. Readability is more important than strict adherence to the guidelines.

This guide is based on PEP8. If information is found to be lacking here, go with what PEP8 says, and notify me at AnthonyReid99@gmail.com to update the guide.
